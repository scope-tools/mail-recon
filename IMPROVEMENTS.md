# MailRecon - Fixed Issues & Improvements

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Empty Requirements File**
- **Problem**: `requirements.txt` was completely empty, causing `ModuleNotFoundError` for all dependencies
- **Solution**: Added all required dependencies with proper version constraints:
  - `requests>=2.28.0` - For HTTP API calls
  - `reportlab>=3.6.0` - For PDF report generation
  - `python-whois>=0.8.0` - For domain whois lookups
  - `dnspython>=2.2.0` - For DNS resolution

### 2. **Missing Virtual Environment Setup**
- **Problem**: Dependencies couldn't be installed due to system package restrictions
- **Solution**: 
  - Installed required system packages (`python3-venv`, `python3-pip`)
  - Created proper virtual environment (`.venv`)
  - Successfully installed all Python dependencies

### 3. **Import Errors**
- **Problem**: Application couldn't run due to missing module imports
- **Solution**: All scanner modules now import correctly with proper dependencies installed
